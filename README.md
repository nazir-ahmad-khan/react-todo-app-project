This Todo List application is built using React and demonstrates practical usage of modern React hooks such as **useState** and **useRef**.

The app allows users to:

- Add new todos using a button or the Enter key

- Edit existing todos with instant input focus

- Delete individual todos

- Clear all todos with a confirmation dialog

- Automatically focus the input field after actions

- Automatically scroll to the latest todo when new items are added

The project focuses on clean UI behavior, smooth user experience, and real-world React patterns such as controlled inputs, conditional rendering, and DOM manipulation using refs.-
